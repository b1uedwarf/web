The philosopher Socrates remains, as he was in his lifetime (469–399 B.C.E.),
an enigma, an inscrutable individual who, despite having written nothing, is
considered one of the handful of philosophers who forever changed how philosophy
itself was to be conceived.<br> All our information about him is second-hand and most
of it vigorously disputed, but his trial and death at the hands of the Athenian
democracy is nevertheless the founding myth of the academic discipline of philosophy
, and his influence has been felt far beyond philosophy itself, and in every age.
Because his life is widely considered paradigmatic not only for the philosophic
life but, more generally, for how anyone ought to live, Socrates has been
encumbered with the adulation and emulation normally reserved for religious
figures – strange for someone who tried so hard to make others do their own
thinking and for someone convicted and executed on the charge of irreverence
toward the gods. Certainly he was impressive, so impressive that many
others were moved to write about him, all of whom found him strange by
the conventions of fifth-century Athens: in his
appearance, personality, and behavior, as well as in his views and methods.
